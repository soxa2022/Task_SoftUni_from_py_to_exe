# Task_SoftUni_from_py_to_exe
Convert .py file into .exe file. I use two methods to convert the programs. 
The first method is with pip plug-in auto-py-to-exe. 
The second one is with PyInstaller from pip by terminal in Pycharm. 
The project contents three small programs .The source code which I use is 90% copied  (ask_me, ping_pong and calculator).
Promgram "ask_me" is using "libraries tkinter and random". The other two program is using kivy platform for applications.
