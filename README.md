# Task_SoftUni_from_py_to_exe
Convert Python file into exe. file.
I use two methods to covert programs.
The first method is with pip plug-in auto-py-to-exe.
The second one is with PyInstaller from pip by terminal in Pycharm.
The project contents three small programs which 90% of the code I fork(ask_me, ping_pong and calculator).
Promgram "ask_me" is using "liberies tkinter and random".
The other two program is using kivy platform.
